"""The meshom config: one TOML file that drives a batch run (`meshom run CONFIG`) and that the UI reads and writes.

docs/config.md has the full description and an example. Tables (units: metres, km^2 for areas, seconds):

    [mesh]    method (a meshom.methods.METHODS name), opts (table, given to the method as is), out (run directory,
              default .tmp/runs/<config stem>), scale (default 1: the final h is multiplied by it, as in

    [[blocks]]  hand-placed curvilinear blocks, fixed blocks of the m14 methods (meshom.methods.m14.hand, B60):
              name, corners = [[lon, lat] x 4] (counter-clockwise, the block on the left of each side), rows (cells
              along side 1-2), cols (along side 2-3; both default: from h), h_m (the cell size inside; default h),
              sides (4 of "coast", "cut", "lat", "offset"; default per side: coast when both corners lie within 1 h
              of one coast loop and the coast path between them is shorter than 3 x the chord, else cut), snap_m
              (corners of coast sides within it move onto the coast; default 1 h), filter_m (the coast sides' filter;
              default 2 h)
    [gates]   overrides of DEFAULT_GATES (quality gates)
    [bathymetry]  source ("none" = no bathymetry stage, the FESOM files get a placeholder depth; else a netCDF grid
              of elevation, positive up, such as GEBCO 2024), variable ("elevation"), min_depth_m (10: shallower
              wet nodes are set to it), depth_at ("node": depth per node, the mean of the grid's ocean cells in the

              set, default "core2" = the 48 CORE2 levels, or a file with nl then nl values such as an aux3d.out),
              min_layers (4: fesom2 / fesom3 depth >= zbar[4] = 30 m), smooth_passes (0 = off), max_slope (0 = off),
              carve_taper (1: the strait floors' cosine taper in strait h_m; meshom.bathymetry.depth_policy)
    [[bathymetry.regions]]  depth rules by area (C1, decisions O35, O36), after every other depth rule, in file
              order: name, box = [lon_min, lat_min, lon_max, lat_max] (lon_min > lon_max: across 180) or polygon =
              [[lon, lat], ...]; depth_m (set), min_depth_m, max_depth_m (in that order); then the floor
              (meshom.bathymetry.apply_regions)
    [run]     timeout (s, the method's child process is killed after it), smooth (also run the common smoothing),
              figures (render the standard picture set)

The base h (`Config.base_h`) is the largest enabled constant layer, else h_max_m, else none: coast_distance layers stop
growing there and zones grow to it. `load` returns a Config of typed dataclasses; a key that is not in the schema is
an error naming its path (e.g. "size.layers[2].transiton_m: unknown key"). Values are not checked further (input
scope: the user fixes the config). `dumps(load(p))` loads back equal; `enabled = true` and empty names are not written.

Each gate is evaluated on the whole mesh and, where the metric has them, on the `_coast`, `_interior`, `_coast3` and
`_strait` subsets (gate names with that suffix); see meshom.quality.metrics.check_gates. `boundary_rule` is an
option, not a gate: which elements the `boundary_edges_max` gate applies to.
