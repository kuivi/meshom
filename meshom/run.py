"""Batch runs from a config (`meshom run CONFIG`, `meshom runs [DIR]`): the pipeline the UI and scripts share.

run(cfg):
1. coast: [coast] source -> meshom.coast.Coast (loops with water on the left, merged across 180°; Antarctica from the
   GSHHS L5 / L6 file next to an L1 source, [coast] antarctica), or none;
2. size: the [[size.layers]] in file order (min; zone modes set / smooth act on the running h) -> clip to [size] h_min_m / h_max_m -> min with the strait zones ([coast] straits,
   [[straits]]: meshom.straits) and, with [coast] auto_straits, the automatic ones (meshom.lfs.auto_straits: h = W/n
   on the passages of the coast's medial axis that h_min keeps open) -> gradient limiter (grad_max) -> x scale;
3. domain: "none" -> the closed sphere; treatment "loops" -> the coast filtered to h (meshom.coast_filter: opening of
   the water at h, closing at h/2, strait corridors protected; stage coast_filter) and resampled at h; treatment
   "cut" -> the closed sphere, and after the method the elements whose centroid is on land are removed and the mask
   cleaned with FESOM2's rules (meshom.methods.m14.cut: spurs, pinched nodes, the largest basin), as fesom2_mesh_gen
   cuts JIGSAW; the strait corridors are water whatever the coast says and are protected in the clean-up
   (meshom.straits);
3b. hand-placed blocks ([[blocks]], meshom.methods.m14.hand.resolve): the corners snapped and the four sides laid
   on the sphere against the true coast (treatment "cut": the method sees no coast) or the filtered one (treatment
   "loops": the coast the method gets), h_m x scale, rows and cols / scale; given to the method as opts["blocks"]
   (the m14 methods build them as fixed blocks, B60); in the land cut the cells of a built block with a coast side
   are water and protected and the element across each of its fitted bank edges is land (as m14/cut.py), the other
   blocks are cut by the mask;
4. the method runs in a child process killed after [run] timeout (compete._generate / compete._spawn, shared with
   `meshom compete`), with [mesh] opts plus the run's size tolerance (Config.size_tolerance: 0.20 for m14 by
   default, 0 = off; decisions G38), then optionally the common smoothing;
5. scoring as in `meshom compete` (compete._score: quality summary, size fidelity, irregular counts against rho_c,
   gates; the size gate at the size tolerance, Config.gates_all), the standard figures when asked;
5b. the optimisation stage (meshom.optimize, decisions Z1): [mesh] optimize unset = the method's default
   (methods.own_optimize: on for the m14 methods), true / false forced. A method with its own stage (option
   "optimize": the m14 methods) runs it as its last stage, given [mesh] optimize and optimize_opts in its opts, so
   raw.npz is already optimised (record <run dir>/optimize.json) and no "optimized" record is made; otherwise (other
   methods, and the m14 methods under a land cut, which then run without it) the run applies it here on the final
   mesh (smoothed if smoothing ran) at the run's size tolerance with [mesh] optimize_opts, saved as optimized.npz,
   scored as the record "optimized" (its "optimize" block: per-step counts, times, before / after counts, checks)
   and from then on the final mesh (bathymetry, write, straits);
6. bathymetry ([bathymetry] source, meshom.bathymetry.node_depth): depth per node of the final mesh, positive down,
   at least the floor (min_depth_m, and for fesom2 / fesom3 the bottom of the min_layers-th level), then the depth
   rules of meshom.bathymetry.depth_policy (smoothing, slope limiter, the straits' tapered depth floors), the
   method's own node depths (m16_orca), then the [[bathymetry.regions]] rules in file order (model_depth, decisions
   O35, O36), saved as depth.npy;
7. the final mesh in [mesh] format: "fesom-c" (default; meshom.io.fesom.write_fesomc), "fesom2" (write_fesom2:
   nod2d.out, elem2d.out, aux3d.out with the [bathymetry] levels, then fesom2_checks on the written files) or
   "fesom3" (write_fesom3: 4-column elem2d.out and aux3d.out, then fesom3_checks, and fesom_ini with 1 partition
   when [mesh] fesom3_ini names the binary: run_fesom_ini, work folder fesom_ini/);
8. straits (when the config has any): meshom.straits.strait_report on the final mesh and depth, in stages.json (stage
   "straits") and in the final quality.json record ("straits"), with the water components of the final mesh
   ("water": count, nodes, area, box, the straits ending in each cut-off one, `connectivity_ok` = one component and
   every strait's two ends in it; a failed check is reported, the run goes on: decisions C44).

The run directory (`[mesh] out`, `--out`, default .tmp/runs/<config stem>) holds config.resolved.toml (every default
filled in, paths absolute), stages.json (one record per stage: coast, size, blocks, coast_filter, generate, post,
smooth, score, optimize, figures, bathymetry, write), quality.json ({"raw": record, "smooth": record,
"optimized": record}, records as `meshom compete` writes them),
raw.npz, smooth.npz, optimized.npz, depth.npy, fesom/ (the files of the final mesh) and figures/{raw,smooth}/.

write_mesh(run_dir, mesh_name, fmt, out, progress, fesom_ini) (`meshom write`): a saved mesh of a run folder (a hand
edit edited-NN.npz, raw, smooth, a repair) as model files with the run's config: depth recomputed (step 6; saved as
<out>/depth_base.npy, then the mesh's node edits <mesh stem>.depth_edits.json when there is one), files and
checks (step 7) into <run_dir>/fesom-<mesh stem>/, the mesh scored (step 5), the straits and passages checked (step
8, C51: check only), fesom_ini on request, all into its quality.json. Its caches in <run_dir>/cache/ (size.pkl: the
size field; rho_c.json: the rho_c integrals per domain; depth.npz: the GEBCO box sums) make a write after a small hand
edit take seconds.
